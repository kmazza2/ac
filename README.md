# ac
These are flex, bison, and make files for generating a calculator utilizing GNU MPFR for all calculations. It is especially useful for calculating numerical solutions to problems in combinatorics, which are sometimes very large and require trickery to compute with double precision floating point numbers.

Now, instead of mentally compiling your expressions into Polish notation and coercing them into a C program (after drudging through the MPFR API docs for hours), you can type them in at the command line and see what they evaluate to instantly. ðŸ˜Ž
```

./ac

4 * atan(1)  // 3.14159...
